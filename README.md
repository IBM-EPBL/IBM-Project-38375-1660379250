## INTRODUCTION
 
Over half the population of the world regardless of their identity are the users who consume news on social media.<br/>
The major issue is whether or not to trust the news fed by the various websites and the frequent topics which are irrelevant to the user. This issue arises when the user has no knowledge to identify whether the websites visited are certified or not.This issue must be solved so as to avoid fake news and to feed the user with relevant news instantly.<br/>
A better solution is to introduce a one-stop solution as an application with user Interface, categorizable and filterable content, easy offline access and social media integration.


## MOTIVATION
 
With the news being created every minute and relayed through TV, radio and internet, the updated news is already old by the next morning. And, thatâ€™s why newspaper and magazine publishers are struggling to keep-up with the pace. Change is needed and publishers must embrace mobile.<br/>
A better solution is to introduce a one-stop solution as an application with user Interface, categorizable and filterable content, easy offline access and social media integration.
